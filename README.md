# E2E - HARMONI End-to-End Model Performance Analysis :octocat:

Welcome to the **E2E** GitHub repo: a set of performance analysis simulations for the HARMONI End-to-End Model, an optical model of the complete system including all subsystems: Focal Plane Relay System, Preoptics, Integral Field Unit, Spectrograph, Detectors :telescope:. This repo contains Python code that uses the Zemax Optics Studio (ZOS) API to analyse the HARMONI E2E files.

## What do we want to achieve? (*project rationale*)

*What are the End-to-End Models?* The E2E models are optical models in Zemax Optics Studio that represent the complete HARMONI instrument. They are created by joining together optical models of each subsystem provided by different teams within the [HARMONI consortium](https://auditore.cab.inta-csic.es/harmoni/consortium/) all across Europe :gb: :es: :fr: :de:. One of the main roles of the E2E models is to _demonstrate that the performance of HARMONI will meet the requirements_. Given the complexity of the HARMONI instrument and the myriad of possible configurations, this task cannot be done manually with a handful of Zemax analyses. This is where this repo comes in.

*What does the E2E repo do?* At the University of Oxford we are in charge of putting together the E2E models and **analysing their performance**; and this is where I come in. The E2E repo contains a bunch of Python code to automate this task, including custom performance analyses designed to match the peculiarities of HARMONI, as well as post-processing routines to plot and summarise the instrument's performance.

## This project is still under construction ðŸš§


Using the Zemax Optics Studio (ZOS) API in Python we analyse the E2E Zemax files for HARMONI across:

* **Spaxel Scales** [milliarcseconds]: 4x4, 10x10, 20x20, 60x30
* **Spectral Bands**: VIS, IZJ, IZ, Z_HIGH, J, H, K, HK, H_HIGH, K_LONG, K_SHORT
* **Integral Field Unit Channel**: 4 pairs of channels AB, CD, EF, GH
* **Adaptive Optics modes**: NOAO, SCAO, LTAO, HCAO (High Contrast)
* **System Configurations**: Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS), full HARMONI, and complete with E-ELT

The shear number of possible combinations of spaxel scales, spectral bands, type of analysis, etc, calls for an automated approach to performance analysis. This package provides such functionality

Analysis implemented so far include:

* **Raytracing** (general): to validate the field definitions along the optical path across all spaxel scales
* **RMS Wavefront Error**: can be calculated at any arbitrary surface with custom sampling
* **FWHM PSF**: geometric PSF based on raytracing + diffraction effects + detector effects
* **Ensquared Energy**: geometric value in spatial direction
* **Spot Diagrams**: see example below at the Detector Plane

As an example, we can calculate the RMS Wavefront Error map at the detector plane for all 4 IFU channels for a given set of spaxel scale, spectral band, system configuration, etc.

or we can display the results using box and whisker plots to compare the RMS Wavefront Error across multiple spectral bands

We can also calculate Spot Diagrams at the detector plane:
